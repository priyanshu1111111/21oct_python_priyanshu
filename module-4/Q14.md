# Q15. How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes:

## ANSWER

In Python, you can have multiple except statements for a single try block. Each except block handles a specific type of exception.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise exceptions
except FirstException:
    handle_first_one()
except SecondException:
    handle_second_one()
except (ThirdException, FourthException, FifthException) as e:
    handle_either_of_3rd_4th_or_5th()
except Exception:
    handle_all_other_exceptions()
```

Built-in Exception Classes:

ZeroDivisionError: Raised when dividing by zero.
IndexError: Raised when accessing an invalid index in a list or tuple.
KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
ValueError: Raised for invalid function arguments or data types.
TypeError: Raised for incorrect function or operation types.
FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file is not found.
AssertionError: Raised when an assertion fails.
