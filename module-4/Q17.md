# Q17. When is the finally block executed?

## ANSWER:

A finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.
EX.

```python
try:
    # Your code that might raise exceptions
except SomeException:
    # Exception handling
finally:
    # Code to execute regardless of exceptions

```
