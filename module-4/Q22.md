# Q22. How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class

## ANSWER:

To define a class, use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon.

self allows you to access and modify attributes and call methods within that instance.

EX.

```python
class test:
    a=10
    b=20

    def printdata(self):
        print(f'Sum of A + B: {self.a + self.b}')

result=test()

result.printdata()

#OUTPUT: Sum of A + B: 30
```
