# Q27. What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

## ANSWER:

python has isinstance() method to check whether an object is instance or not.

```python
class A:
    pass

obj = A()

# Check if 'obj' is an instance of class 'A'
if isinstance(obj, A):
    print("obj is an instance of class A")
else:
    print("obj is not an instance of class A")
```
