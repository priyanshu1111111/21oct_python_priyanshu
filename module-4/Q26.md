# Q26. What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

## ANSWER:

In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance of a class. When you instantiate a class, you create an actual object in memory based on the class blueprint. This object (or instance) can then be used to access the classâ€™s attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

# Instantiate a Car object
my_car = Car(make="Toyota", model="Camry")
```
