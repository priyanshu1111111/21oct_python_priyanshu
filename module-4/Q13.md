# Q13. Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

## ANSWER

Exception handling in Python is a process of resolving errors that occur in a program. This involves catching exceptions, understanding what caused them, and then responding accordingly. Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime when the program is being executed.

There are two types of error in python.

1. Syntex Error:

```python
a=10
b=20

if a < b
    print(f'Sum of A + B= {a+b}')

# Output: Syntax error due to the Missing colon after the if statement.

```

2. Logical Error:

```python
a=10
b='Hello'

if a < b:
    print(f'Sum of A + B= {a+b}')

# Output: Error due to unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

```
