14.What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Ans= Python programming language supports negative indexing of arrays,
 something which is not available in arrays in most other programming languages.
  This means that the index value of -1 gives the last element, 
  and -2 gives the second last element of an array. 
  The negative indexing starts from where the array ends.
