# Q18. What happens when "1" == 1 is executed?

## ANSWER:

When the expression "1" == 1 is executed in Python, it checks whether the string "1" is equal to the integer 1. The result of this comparison is False, because the types are different: one is a string, and the other is an integer. In Python, equality (==) compares both the value and the type.
